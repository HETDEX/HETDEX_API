## Bad shots

A list of badshots that should be removed according to science goals are contained in:

hetdex_api/known_issues/hdr2/badshots.list


HDR1 bad shots that we will remove again
		
20170127v007 = no exp02/03 match pdf
20170306v020 = no exp02/03 match pdf
20170306v021 = only 1 star for astrometry
20170427v006 = questionable astrometry.. only two stars
20171014v007 = trackign went off on last track
20171025v009 = tracking went bad on last track
20171222v013 = no exp02/03 match pdf
20180313v017 = astrometry is bad
20180316v016 = tracking went bad on last track
20180517v015 = no exp02/03 match pdf
20181205v012 = streaks all over on last dither
20190413v014 = astrometry failed, bad shot
20190907v020 = astrometry failed, bad shot
20191004v019 = astrometry failed, bad shot
20191227v028 = astrometry failed, bad shot

These shots are all bad for various reasons, no 3rd dither, or really low flux in 3rd dither or multiple reasons. They made it into hdr2.dex list but most were not in HDR1 and those that were aren't useful
